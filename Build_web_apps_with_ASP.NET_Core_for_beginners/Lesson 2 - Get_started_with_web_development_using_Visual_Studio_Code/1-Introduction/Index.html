<!--* Introduction -->
    <!--
        * Its impressive what you can do on the web today. You can build web experience that run on all devidces, include all sorts
        * of media content, and perform complicated computation. You can even create apps that look and feel like native applications.
        *
        * If you're interested in starting web development today, you might be faced with a dizzying array of options. In this
        * module, you'll learn the basic components of website and some tools you can use to start web development. You'll use HTML, CSS
        * and JavaScript together to build a website and then use develper tools in the browser to understand what's happening.
        *
        * With this fundamental knowledge in place, you'll have a better context to make decisions in the future whe building websites;
        * for exemple, whether you should choose JavaScript frameworks or create you own JavaScript functions to build your website.

<!--* Scenario -->
    <!--
            * Imagine that you're a web developer, and you've been asked to make your company's website appeal to a broader range
            * of customers. To allow your customers to customize their experience on your website, you decide to add support for light
            * and dark themes. You crea a small, proof-of-concept website to demonstrate support for themes using CSS, and you write a
            * JavaScript function to toggle between these themes.
            *

<!--* What's in a web page -->
    <!--
        * The content, style, and interactive logic are separated into HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, respectively. A design principle
        * in modern programing is separation of concerns. Among the many reasons to separate concerns, two are simplicity and reuse. For
        * exemple, by styling HTML elements using CSS, you can simplify your HTML code. Instead of coding the apperarance within each element,
        * you apply CSS style to all the elements on a page, regardless of the page complexity. In addition, you can link multiple HTML pages
        * to a single CSS file, which can help simplify a consistent look and feel across your entire website
