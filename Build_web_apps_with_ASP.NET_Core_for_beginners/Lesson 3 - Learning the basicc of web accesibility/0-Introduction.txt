Ensuring that your webpage is accessible to all users and all clients is critical. As Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of World 
Wide Web, once said: "The power of the Web is in its universality. Acess by everyone regardless of disability is an essentian aspect"

As a burgeoning web developer, you belive that learning how to ensure that your pages are acessible early on is important. It's always 
easier to build a page to be acessible than it is to retrofit it later. If you learn these skills when you first start down the path they'll
become natural. You can then create accessible pages and spot potential pitfalls.
