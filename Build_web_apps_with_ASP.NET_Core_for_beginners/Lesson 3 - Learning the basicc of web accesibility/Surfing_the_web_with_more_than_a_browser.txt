You are probably very familiar wit using a browser as a client to browse the web. When you think about designing
webpages, you can picture the user experience with this client because you have personal experience with ir. But not all
users use a browser in the same way, or use a browser at all. To crea experiences for all users, you should understand the 
various tools that people might use when they browse the Web

Screen readers
    One of the best-know accessibility tools is a screen reader. Screen readers are commonly used clients for peoples with
    vision impairments. They're build into most operations systems. As we spend time ensuring that a browser properly conveys
    the information that we want to share, we must also ensure that a screen reader does the same

    At it mos basic, a screen reader read s a page from top to bottom audibly. If your page is all text, the reader conveys the
    information in a similar way to browser. Of course, webpages are rarely  purely text; they contain links, graphics, color, and
    other visual components. Care must be taken to ensure that a screen reader can correctly read this information.

    Some browsers also have built-in tools and extesions that can read text aloud or even provide som basic navigational features,
    such as these accessibility-focused Edge browser tools. These browser tools are also important accessibility tools, but they
    function differntly from screen readers.

Zoom
    Another tool that people with vision impairments commonly use is zooming. The most basic type of zooming is static zoom, which
    is controlled through the keyboard shortcut or by decreasing screen resolution. This type os zoom resizes the entire page. Using
    resposive design, where  items shift based on the viewport, is impotant to provide a good user experience at increased zoom levels
