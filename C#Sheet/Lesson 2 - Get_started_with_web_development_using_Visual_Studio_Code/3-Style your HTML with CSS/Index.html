<!--
    * Carscading Style Sheet (CSS) let you specify how your page should look. The basic is to define what the style should be for the elements that you
    * use within  your HTML pages. While the HTML elements define your content, CSS styles define what this content looks like.
    *
    * For exemple, you can apply rounded corners or give a gradient background to an element, or you cn use CSS tpo specify how hyperlinks look and
    * respond when you interact with them. You can also perform sophisticated page layout and animation effects.
    *
    * You can apply styles to specific elements, all elements of a specific type, or use classes to style many different elements.
-->

<!--* External CSS --> <!--
    * One benefit of external CSS is that multiple HTML pages can link to the same CSS file. If you make a change to the CSS, your styling is updated for
    * each page. When you use an HTML file for your page content, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for interaction, it's called separation 
    * of concern.
    *
    * As described previously, you can also write CSS directly in HTML, which is called intenal CSS. Even for a basic website, there are so many CSS rules the HTML 
    * page can  became cluttered quickly. With more than one page, the same CSS would  often be repeated and challenging to manage.
    *
    * continuos in the main.css
