<!--
    * JavaScript (or ECMAScript) is a progrmming languages that helps you add interactivity to your web pages.
    *
    * For example, you can use JavaScript to define the behabior that happens when a user selects a button, like opening a popup window. Using JavaScript, you
    * can add or remove content from web page without reloading it.
    *
    * In this unit, you set an exemple JavaScript file for you web page. In it, you create  a button to switch, between light an dark themes. Then, you attach the button to JavaScript
    * code that performs the actual theme switching.
-->

<!--* Link to JavaScript  --> <!--
    * Like CSS, you could add JavaScript directly to the HTML file, but a recommended best practice is to save your JavaScript in a separate file. Adding your JavaScript
    * code to a separate file makes it easier to reuse it across several web pages. For example, you could create a pop-up alert by adding the following code anywhere within
    * the body of your web pages:
    *   '<script>alert('Hello World')</script>'
    *
    * However, it's better to add you JavaScript code to a separate file that you can link to every file that needs
    * your custom functionality.
    *
    * The HTML script tag let us link to an external JavaScript file.
    *
    * You could place the '<script>' element in the '<head>' or elsewhere in the '<body>'. However, putting the '<script>' element at the end of the
    * '<body>' section enables all the page content to display on the screen first, before the script is loaded.
-->

<!--* Add fault tolerance  --> <!--
    * Adding the '<noscript>' element is an example of fault tolerance or graceful degradation. When you use the '<noscript>' element, your code can detect and
    * plan for when a feature isn't supported or available.
    *
    * the lesson continous in the app.js

<!--* Add a buttn  --> <!--
    * You need a way to let your users switch the light and dark themes in your web page.
