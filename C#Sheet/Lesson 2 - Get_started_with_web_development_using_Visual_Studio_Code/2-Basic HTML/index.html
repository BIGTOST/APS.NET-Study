<!--* Add some HTML code --> <!--
    * Visual Studio Code provides basic support for HTML programming out of the box. 
    * There's syntax highlighting, smart completions with IntelliSense, and customizable formatting.
    *
    * There have been diferent versions of HTML. The doctype '<!DOCTYPE html>' indicates this HTML documents
    * contains HTML5 code
    *
    * While we aren't going to delve deeply into the meaning of all the HTML elements, we want to point out a few important items. The 
    * '<meta>' tag indicates metadata informations that isn't typically visible to the viewers unless they biew the source code in their 
    * browser. Meta elements or tags provide descriptive information about the webpage. For exemple, they help search engines process
    * which information in your webpages to return in search results
    *
    * The charecter set (charset) fot UTF-8 might seem insignificant, but it's crucial for establishing how computers interpret characters-
    * If the metadata  for the character set is missing, that can lead to compromissed security. There's quite a bit of history and technical
    * information behind the charset attribute, but the important takeaway from this exercise is that the Visual studio Code boilerplate provides
    * some sensible default
-->

<!--* Edit the head --> <!--
    * The '<head>' elemente in your HTML code contains information about your website not visible inside the browser tab.
    *
    * The metadata defines data about the HTML document, such as character sets, scripts, and which browser the webpage opens in
    *
    * The tittle of webpage appears at the top of a browser window, and is signifcant in many ways. For exemple the title is used
    * by and displayed in seach engines.
    *
    * To apply styles to the HTML elemenst on the webpage, you could write the CSS code directly in the webpage head. Writing CSS
    * in the HTML page ios called internal CSS. However, its a best practice to separate HTML structure and CSS styling. Having a
    * separete CSS page is called external CSS. Code tends to be easier to read when it's concise and compartmentalized. You can use
    * more external style sheets to service multiple webpages. Rather than updating each HTML page with replicated CSS code, you can 
    * make changes to single CSS file and have those updates applied to all of the dependent web pages. 
-->

<!--* Edit the Body  --> <!--
    * You can use an ID attribute (used in the <p> element) for styling one element, while the class attribute (used in the <li> element)
    * is for styling all elements of the same class
    *
    * before do watherve u want with the code, remebe to save the file
-->

<!--* Open in browser -->  <!--
    * You can preview your webpage locally by opening the HTML file in browser. Instead of a website address
    * that begins with 'https://', your browser points to the local file path, wich should look similar to C:/dev/simple-website/index.html
-->

<!--* View the page using developer tools --> <!--
    * You can inspect a webpage by using the developer tools browser.
    *   more information about the devtoosl: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/overview
    *
    * The Elements tab in developer tools shows you the document object model (DOM) as rendered in the browser. When debugging, its
    * often important to see how the browser interprets your source code.
    *
    * Inspecting the page in browser provides all sorts of useful information and can help you troubleshoot problems. You can also
    * view CSS details with the inspector.
